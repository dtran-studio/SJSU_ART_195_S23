            <p>We are all made of the same Earth. Water, grime, flesh, blood. Nothing separates the me that exists in you. Whatever you think you feel in the current notion, is a lie; I reveal and seduce your true feelings through my visions, and manipulate your soggy, pink mass of fat that sits armored on your pillared body towards the demons that torment my own little world. Cookie cut perfection, a line straighter that a heterosexual, isnâ€™t that fun? Feed yourself, lose some weight, come out of the closet, be a proper woman, relax, study harder, have a social life, build walls around you to the point they become physical and trap you in your own illusion of your room. What am I doing wrong? I quake at the smallest error, I freeze at the sight of them, why do I suffer every single moment that I am aware. Zone in, zone out, zone in, zone out, mask it all, mask it all so no one notices. I showed you my fears, I became vulnerable to you, a stranger who meandered into my realm. Accept my woes, and drink air by the mouthfuls, once you take a step, you will suffocate in my shoes</p></center>
